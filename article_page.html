        <h2 class="js_head">&bull; J's Restaurant</h2>
        <p>J's Restaurant has two locations located in Gualo Rai and San Jose. My go to spot would be the one located in Gualo Rai, because of the long history of my 
            family and I going there. My favorite meals I always order are the Cheeseburger with Fries and the Hamburger Steak. They also have a small arcade area for entertainment.</p>

        <h2 class="sea_head">&bull; New Seaside Restaurant</h2>
        <p>New Seaside Restaurant is located along beach road passing National Office Supply heading North. It was formerly known as "New Double Restaurant."
            My favorite dishes to get there are the Spicy Eggplant, Seweet and Sour Pork, and the Beef Broccoli.
            I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some Chinese cuisine.

        <p>
            Cup Bab has two locations. One is located in San Jose, and is sort of an order-and-go type of restaurant. The other is located in 
            Garapan, with a dine-in and drive-thru option available. My favorite meal is the Volcano Bab, which is a spicy pork bulgogi on top of rice and noodles.
